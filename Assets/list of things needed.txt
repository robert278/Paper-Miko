2D Overworld
-Natural Platforming Script [easy]
-Fall Off Damage Script [easy]
-Enemy attacks dealing damage 
-Enemy melee attacks first striking
-Your 'Hammer' or 'Gohei' causing a first strike on collision
-Later -- your Yin-yang causing first strike? or have a collider appear when you jump and check if that lands on an enemy's head
-Text System
-Menu System
-Flip to 3D? 

Battle System
-Turn Based
-Health and XP recorded after each battle
-Action Command minigames
-Battle Menu System

For the "Demo"
-Turn Based Battles
-Health and XP recorded after each battle
-Template for allowing Action Commands of different types to be added in
	--Ideally, you read from a 'list' of Action Commands you can add to, each Action Command has customizable 'time when occurs' and 'button needed to be pressed' or do Random.int()
-Battle Menu System


Things to Fix:
-Camera Flip Sticking

***Character "coloring" UI
***Level & Enemy Editor UI -> Sliders for custom Health, Attack, Defense and ability to let player color shapes or draw shapes


Don't worry about first strike first -- assume all battles are collision only at first
